          <h2 class="bio-title">The Alchemist of Words</h2>
          <p>Born 1992 September 30, poet-vocalist Nomashenge Dlamini is a Ladysmith native, raised in Durban and currently based in Johannesburg. Beyond embodying alchemy as a practising, professional pharmacist (with a Bachelor of Pharmacy, Honours Degree), her work is an ever-transmogrifying blend of poetry and vocals, the tangible and spiritual. It simultaneously resonates with and transcends genre, space and era.</p>
